        <h1>   Quick hummus recipe </h1>
        <p>    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. 
        It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years</p>
        <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
            It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
        
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 can (400g) of <strong> chick peas</strong> (garbanzo beans)</li>
            <li>175g of tahini</li>
            <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
            <li><strong>Half</strong> a red pepper</li>
            <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 clove of <em>garlic</em></li>
            <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Remove the skin</strong> from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
            <li>             Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
              <li>  Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
                <li><strong>Process all the ingredients</strong> into a paste.</li>
                <ul>                   <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
                    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
       </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>    For a <em>different flavour</em>, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
        </p>

        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>   <em>Refrigerate the finished hummus</em>  in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
            </li>

            <li>    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should <em>thaw</em>> it and use it within a couple of months.
            </li>
        </ul>
